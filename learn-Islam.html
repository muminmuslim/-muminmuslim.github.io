<p> Assalamu Alykum here is the page for learning about Islam. </p>

<p><b> Assalamu Alaykum. Today we will talk about the importance of charity, forgiveness, and humility. All of these have special rewards that is mentioned in one hadith.

"Charity does not decrease wealth" . This says that if one donates (for the sake of Allah), his wealth will not be decreased (it will be increased insha allah)

In the same hadith, it states, "No one forgives another except that Allah increases his honor"
This tells that if there is a time when someone is seeking forgiveness from us and we forgive him, then our honor will be increased.

In the same hadith, it states, "No one humbles himself for the sake of Allah except that Allah raises his status"
This says that if we humble ourselves (through dhikr/salat/islamic deeds) then Allah will raise our status.(There are ranks and levels in the aakhira, and the higher one is, the more beloved he/she is to Allah. Let's try to do things which will make Allah to raise our status.)

This is the complete Ahadith. You can find this in Sahih Muslim 2588.
Charity does not decrease wealth, no one forgives another except that Allah increases his honor, and no one humbles himself for the sake of Allah except that Allah raises his status.</b></p>
